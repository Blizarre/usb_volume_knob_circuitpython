# USB Volume Knob

This is a small project that uses CircuitPython to create a simple USB volume knob. The knob supports play/pause functionality on short presses, and next track on long presses. This is my first project using [circuitpython](https://circuitpython.org/) and I absolutely loved it.

I used this code on a bootleg ProMicro (rp2040) to have a physical volume know on my desk.

## Features

- **Volume Control**: The knob allows you to control the volume of your device.
- **Play/Pause**: A short press on the knob will play or pause the current track.
- **Next Track**: A long press on the knob will skip to the next track.

You will need the adafruit_hid and adafruit_debouncer [libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).
